    <p> Students are involved in the running of the school, making decisions that affect them and finding solutions to problems that arise. The Student Leadership Council is elected twice a year to represent the student body and give feedback to the GHIS administration and boarding teams. The council meets weekly with a representative from the boarding team, the head of school, and the head of boarding to discuss ongoing campus events, community building, and ideas for enhancing community life. <br> Since Givat Haviva is recognized as the main center for shared society in Israel, it hosts many international politicians and dignitaries. GHIS students are routinely invited to present the school to visitors, giving them high-level experience in public speaking while offering unique opportunities to network with international influencers.</p>

    <br>
    <p> Boarding life is a central tenet of GHIS learning. This becomes your home as well as your school, and we want all students to feel secure, comfortable, and happy. At GHIS you will find an international community that celebrates multicultural voices. Lifelong bonds will be formed with your peers as you share experiences with people who are both similar to you and different. You will be responsible for your extracurricular life, planning and coordinating educational and social activities. <br> Each aspect of boarding life is geared towards helping you achieve your educational and personal goals while at GHIS, and to continue growing outside the classroom.</p>

    <br>
    <p> Committees are an important part of student life at GHIS because they enable students to take an more active role in shaping a particular aspect of the community. <br> Committees work together to create programming for the student body, ranging from holiday parties to culture theme weeks, from election information sessions to recycling campaigns. They provide another path for students to determine their extracurricular programming and daily life at school.</p>

    <br>
    <p> Living side-by-side with students from different backgrounds develops intercultural awareness, which is further enhanced through a host family program in local towns and villages. International students are assigned a host family by the school, providing them with important home-away-from-home experiences while in Israel. During off-campus weekends we recommend international students stay with their host family. In addition, Israeli students are encouraged to invite their peers to their family home.</p>

    <br>
    <p> Extracurricular programs take advantage of Israelâ€™s natural diversity and rich biblical history, offering unique cultural and religious encounters, maritime education, group hikes, archaeological expeditions, and field trips in Israel from the Sea of Galilee in the north to the Red Sea in the south. </p>
